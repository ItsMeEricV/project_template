# New-Project Setup Walkthrough

## Overview

The template's `docker/` stamps ship with opinionated defaults: PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector + Prisma + named volumes + the infra/app worktree split. These defaults are the user's standard stack, but every fork has at least a few decisions that diverge — and "blindly accept the defaults" is wrong often enough that it must be asked, not assumed.

This skill captures the fork-time questions and the exact substitutions each answer triggers. Ask every question below before writing to any file in `docker/`.

It also covers two bootstrap concerns outside `docker/`: how many deploy environments the project has (Q6), and how env vars are declared/detected via a single `environment.ts` (Q7). Both default sensibly but are silently wrong often enough to ask.

**Violating the spirit of these questions wastes the user's time.** Defaults are right ~80% of the time and silently wrong ~20%. Always ask.

## Red Flags — STOP

| Rationalization                                           | Reality                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The Dockerfile already has Prisma, I'll just keep it"    | Prisma is the _template_ default, not necessarily the _project's_ choice. Ask.                                                                          |
| "I'll substitute `app_shared` for the project name later" | Forgetting leaves two projects on the same machine colliding on one network. Do it before first `up`.                                                   |
| "ngrok isn't running so I don't need to ask"              | If the project needs public dev preview (OAuth callbacks, webhook testing), configure it now — not after the user hits a wall.                          |
| "I'll skip pgvector if it's not used yet"                 | pgvector is one apt line. Adding it later means `down -v`, image rebuild, volume loss. Ask up front.                                                    |
| "The user said 'just set up Docker'"                      | "Set up Docker" still means "ask the substitution questions." A user-friendly skill that asks two questions beats a one-shot that ships wrong defaults. |
| "I'll just add the env var I need to `process.env`"       | Every env var goes in the `environment.ts` Zod schema AND gets surfaced to the user. Silent `process.env.FOO` reads are the exact problem Q7 prevents.   |
| "I'll just collapse this to dev + prod, simpler"          | Number of environments is the user's call (Q6). Default is dev + preview + prod (preview → preview) to match Vercel's lanes; only drop the preview lane if they ask. |
| "I'll just use 5433 / 3001 for the port"                  | That guess may already be bound → `up` dies on `bind: address already in use`. Never pick ports by hand or RNG; run `scripts/next-free-port.sh <start>` (Q1). |
| "`lsof` says the port is free, so it's free"              | Only true for what is running *right now*. A project torn down with `compose down` has no container and holds no socket, but reclaims its port the moment it comes back. The script's on-disk reservation scan is what catches those. |

## Workflow

Ask the questions below in order. After all answers are in, perform the substitutions in one batch and surface the diff via `git diff` before any commit.

### Q0: Web app prerequisite (BLOCKING)

The Docker stamp's `web/Dockerfile.dev` builds from `./web` and expects a `package.json` (and, for the Prisma default, `prisma/schema.prisma` + `prisma.config.ts`). On a brand-new fork these don't exist yet — the first `docker compose up web` will fail at the `COPY package*.json ./` step.

Check whether `web/package.json` exists. If yes, skip to Q1. If no, ask: _"There's no Next.js app in `web/` yet. Run `npx create-next-app@latest web` first? I'll walk through the prompts."_

Do not pin the Next.js version or force any specific create-next-app prompts — let the user pick TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, App Router, etc. Once `web/package.json` exists, return to this skill for Q1.

ORM-specific init runs **after** Q2 (so the install reflects the ORM the user actually chooses):

- Prisma → `bash scripts/install-prisma.sh web` (see below); never a bare `npm install prisma @prisma/client`
- Drizzle → `cd web && npm install drizzle-orm pg && npm install -D drizzle-kit @types/pg`
- Kysely / other → install per the user's preference; ask where migrations live
- No ORM → skip the install entirely

#### Prisma install — run the script, don't hand-roll it

```bash
bash scripts/install-prisma.sh web          # --provider / --version to override
```

A bare `npm install prisma @prisma/client && npx prisma init` produces a broken
setup: `latest` is periodically a pre-release, the CLI and client can land on
different majors, and Prisma 7 writes `prisma7.config.ts` while
`web/Dockerfile.dev` copies `prisma.config.ts`. The script pins both packages to
the highest stable version, scaffolds the schema, normalizes the config
filename, declares `dotenv` if the config imports it, and fails loudly if any of
that didn't hold. It is idempotent — re-run it any time to re-assert the checks.

`prisma migrate deploy` (the `Dockerfile.dev` CMD) connects *before* it checks
for migrations, so it fails on the host until infra is up, and exits 0 with
`No migration found in prisma/migrations` once it can connect. Expected on a
fresh project with no models.

### Q1: Project slug + host-port collision (BLOCKING)

Ask: _"What's the project slug? It namespaces the shared Docker network, the db container name, and per-worktree containers — needed to avoid collisions with other projects on this machine. Lowercase, hyphen- or underscore-separated. Example: `taskbird`, `analytics_pipeline`."_

Then assign the db's **host** port — **scan, don't guess.** 5432 may already be held by a stale container or another project, and the stack dies on `bind: address already in use`. This skill's helper prints the lowest port ≥ the start that clears all three checks:

1. not published by a container that still exists (`docker ps -a` — running or stopped),
2. not bound by a listening process on the host,
3. not **reserved on disk** by another project — a `WEB_PORT`/`STUDIO_PORT` in some other `.env.docker`, or a hardcoded published port in a compose file.

```bash
bash scripts/next-free-port.sh 5432
bash scripts/next-free-port.sh 3000 1 -v   # -v explains every port it skips
```

Check 3 is the one that looks skippable and isn't. `docker compose down` **deletes** a project's containers, so a spun-down project is invisible to checks 1 and 2 while still fully intending to bind its port the next time it starts. Giving that port to a new project doesn't avoid the collision — it defers it onto whichever project comes up second, at which point the cause is much harder to see.

The scan defaults to `$HOME/code`; pass `--roots ~/work,~/src` for a different workspace layout, or `--no-scan` to skip it. Use what it prints (5432 if free) and tell the user. Only the host side moves; the container always listens on 5432.

Substitutions:

- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — top-level `name: app-infra` → `name: <slug>-infra` (the standalone Compose project group the shared infra lives in; see step 4 — every infra `up`/`down` passes `-p <slug>-infra`)
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — `app_shared` → `<slug>_shared` (network name _and_ the `name:` field)
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — `container_name: app-db` → `container_name: <slug>-db` (hyphens, matching the container names Compose generates from `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`; the network alias `db` stays unchanged, so the app stack's `DATABASE_URL` keeps using `db:5432` regardless)
- Keep `POSTGRES_DB` / `WORKTREE_DB` underscored while the Docker-side names take hyphens. Those two are SQL identifiers, where `-` is the subtraction operator — hyphenating them forces double-quoting at every SQL reference, through YAML then `sh` then SQL in the `db-init` command. Container, network, and volume names are Docker labels and carry no such constraint.
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — volume `app_postgres_data` → `<slug>_postgres_data` (top-level `volumes:` block — both the key _and_ its pinned `name:` field — _and_ the db service's mount)
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — host port in `"5432:5432"` → `"<host-port>:5432"` (only the left side; the container always listens on 5432 internally)
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` — `POSTGRES_DB` from `app_dev` → `<slug>_dev` (the catalog database, not the worktree one)
- `docker-compose.app.yml` — `app_shared` → `<slug>_shared` (network name _and_ the `name:` field)
- `.env.docker.example` — `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` default from `app-main` → `<slug>-main`, `WORKTREE_DB` from `app_dev_main` → `<slug>_dev_main`

### Q2: ORM choice (BLOCKING)

Ask: _"Which ORM? Default is Prisma. Other options: Drizzle, Kysely, no ORM."_

**Prisma** → no changes. Default is correct.

**Drizzle** → the README's "Swapping ORMs → Drizzle" section has the exact replacement blocks. Apply all four:

- `docker-compose.app.yml`: replace the fenced `studio:` block with the Drizzle variant (different port: 4983 internal, different command: `npx drizzle-kit studio`).
- `web/Dockerfile.dev`: replace the three fenced blocks with the Drizzle no-op variants (no `COPY prisma/`, no `prisma generate`, CMD becomes `npx drizzle-kit migrate && npm run dev`).

**Kysely / no ORM** → strip Prisma fences entirely:

- Delete the `studio:` service from `docker-compose.app.yml` (or replace with project-specific tooling).
- In `web/Dockerfile.dev`, remove Prisma `COPY`, remove `prisma generate`, and replace the final `CMD` with `CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]`.
- Ask the user where migrations get applied (out-of-band CLI? init container? skip for now?).

### Q3: ngrok (NON-BLOCKING)

Ask: _"Does this project need a public ngrok tunnel for the dev server? Common reasons: OAuth callbacks requiring HTTPS, webhook testing from third parties, sharing previews with non-devs."_

**Yes** → two more questions:

1. _"What's your reserved ngrok domain?"_ (free tier supports one static domain per account)
2. _"Which worktree's `WEB_PORT` wins the public URL?"_ Default 3000 (the "main" worktree). Only one worktree at a time can be tunneled because the ngrok command targets a single host port.

Substitutions:

- `docker-compose.infra.yml` (ngrok `command`) — `YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN` → the domain.
- `docker-compose.infra.yml` (ngrok `command`) — `host.docker.internal:3000` → `host.docker.internal:<chosen-port>` if the user picked a non-3000 port.
- `.env.docker.example` — uncomment `COMPOSE_PROFILES` and include `ngrok`; uncomment `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=` placeholder.

**No** → leave the service in place (profile-gated, won't run). The user can flip it on later with one env-var change, no merge.

### Q4: Extra Postgres extensions (NON-BLOCKING)

Ask: _"pgvector is included by default. Need any other PG extensions now? Common ones: PostGIS (geospatial), pg_partman (time-series partitioning), TimescaleDB, pg_uuidv7 (only if you want DB-side UUIDv7 on PG14-17 — PG18's native `uuidv7()` covers most cases)."_

**Yes** → add an apt line per extension to `Dockerfile.db`. Each extension also needs a `CREATE EXTENSION` statement in a migration to activate inside a given database.

**No / unsure** → skip; the user can add extensions later (with a rebuild cost — call this out).

### Q5: Memory limits (NON-BLOCKING — ask only on signal)

Defaults: web 6g, db 1g, studio 500m, ngrok 500m. 6g on web is sized for Next.js + TypeScript + Prisma during dev/build. Ask only if the user has signaled a constraint (low-memory machine, many parallel worktrees). Don't volunteer this question for a typical setup.

If lowering: substitute the `memory:` line in `docker-compose.app.yml` (web) — 2-3g is reasonable for API-only or lighter SSR work.

### Q6: Environment split (BLOCKING)

Ask: _"How many deploy environments does this project need? Default is **development + preview + production**, which maps cleanly onto Vercel's three lanes (local / preview / production). Options: that default three, just development + production, or a single environment (local only / one deploy lane). This decides the `AppEnv` enum and the Vercel-lane detection in `environment.ts` (Q7)."_

The default lane is named `preview` to match Vercel's own `VERCEL_ENV=preview` value, so detection is near-identity. If the user prefers the word "staging," rename `'preview' → 'staging'` in the file — the underlying Vercel value is always `preview`.

Map the answer onto the `references/environment.ts` template:

- **dev + preview + prod** (default) — use the reference as-is. `'preview' → 'preview'` mirrors Vercel's preview lane, so there's nothing to trim.
- **development + production** — delete the `'preview'` entry from `APP_ENVS`, drop `isPreview`, and in `detectEnvironment()` map `'preview' → 'production'` (preview deploys exercise prod-like paths). The trim notes in the reference call out each line to change.
- **single environment** — keep only `'production'` in `APP_ENVS`; `detectEnvironment()` can `return 'production'`. Drop the `is*` flags the project won't branch on.

If unsure, take the default and say so — collapsing to dev + prod later is a small edit to this one file.

### Q7: Environment variables + `environment.ts` (BLOCKING)

The template's biggest silent-footgun is unmanaged environment variables — vars created ad hoc, scattered across `process.env.FOO` reads, with no inventory and no record of which lane each belongs to. Prevent this at bootstrap by installing one `environment.ts` as the single source of truth.

Copy `references/environment.ts` to `web/src/environment.ts`, then trim it per the Q6 answer. The file gives the project:

- the `AppEnv` enum + `ENVIRONMENT` label and `isDevelopment` / `isPreview` / `isProduction` guards,
- Vercel deploy-lane detection via `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` (works server-side and in the browser bundle), with a strict-mode throw on unrecognized values so a misconfigured deploy fails loud instead of silently running as `development`,
- vitest / test-runner detection (`isTesting`, `isVitestRunning`),
- one Zod `EnvSchema` that is the **only** place `process.env` is read.

State the rule to the user and follow it for the rest of setup: **every environment variable goes through `EnvSchema` in `environment.ts`, gets a matching entry in `.env.docker.example`, and is announced to the user when added — never introduced silently.** If the project isn't Next.js + Vercel, the detection signal (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`) must be swapped for that platform's equivalent — flag this rather than shipping the file unchanged.

(The reference intentionally omits Edge Config and other specialized vars — add those per-project, through the same schema.)

## After substitution

1. Run `git diff` and show the user every change you made.
2. If `web/src/` exists, write `web/src/environment.ts` from `references/environment.ts`, trimmed per the Q6 split, and run `npx prettier --write web/src/environment.ts`. Show it in the diff alongside the docker changes.
3. Prompt: _"Run `cp .env.docker.example .env.docker` and edit per-worktree values (`WEB_PORT`, `STUDIO_PORT`, `WORKTREE_DB`, `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`) before bringing the stack up."_ Scan for `WEB_PORT`/`STUDIO_PORT` too — don't guess: `scripts/next-free-port.sh 3000` and `… 5555` (or `… 3000 2` for two at once). Re-run per worktree; each needs its own free ports.
4. Recommend the bring-up order:
   - Once per machine, its own project: `docker compose -p <slug>-infra -f docker-compose.infra.yml --env-file .env.docker up -d`. `-p <slug>-infra` keeps infra a standalone group shared across worktrees — it outranks the per-worktree `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` that `--env-file` injects, so infra isn't absorbed into a worktree's group. Keep `--env-file` (loads `COMPOSE_PROFILES`/`NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`). Tear down with the same `-p <slug>-infra`.
   - Once per worktree: `docker compose -f docker-compose.app.yml --env-file .env.docker up`.
   - On first `up` of the app stack, the `db-init` service creates the worktree database inside the shared Postgres and exits; `web` and `studio` are gated on its successful completion.
5. Do **not** run `docker compose up` yourself unless the user explicitly asks. Long-running processes and "is this healthy?" judgement belong to the user on first boot.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                                                         | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Substituted `app_shared` in only one file                       | The two compose files must agree exactly — name mismatch means the app stack can't join the infra network.                                                                                                              |
| Substituted network but forgot `container_name` / port / volume | Two projects on the same machine collide on `container_name: app-db`, host port 5432, or the `app_postgres_data` volume. The network alias `db` stays stable; only the container name, host port, and volume name move. |
| Replaced only some ORM fences                                   | An app.yml `studio:` running Prisma against a Drizzle codebase fails on `up`. Replace _all_ fences in _both_ files.                                                                                                     |
| Skipped Q4 and added an extension later                         | `down -v` + image rebuild = volume loss. Bring this up at bootstrap.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Forgot ngrok target port                                        | ngrok's `host.docker.internal:3000` only forwards to the worktree publishing `WEB_PORT=3000`. Document which worktree that is.                                                                                          |
| Picked a db / `WEB_PORT` / `STUDIO_PORT` by hand or RNG         | May already be bound → `up` fails (`bind: address already in use`). Use `scripts/next-free-port.sh <start>` for the next free port; re-run per worktree. |
| Trusted a "free" port while other projects were spun down       | `compose down` removes containers, so neither `docker ps -a` nor `lsof` sees the port another project owns. The reservation scan (check 3) prevents this; don't pass `--no-scan` to make an inconvenient answer go away. |
| Hand-rolled the Prisma install instead of running the script    | `latest` can be a pre-release, CLI/client can land on different majors, and `Dockerfile.dev` copies `prisma.config.ts`, not `prisma7.config.ts`. Run `scripts/install-prisma.sh`. |
| Edited `.env.docker.example` instead of `.env.docker`           | `.example` is the source of truth for which vars _exist_; the real one is per-worktree, gitignored, and is what Compose actually reads.                                                                                 |
| Ran infra `up` without `--env-file .env.docker`                 | `COMPOSE_PROFILES=ngrok` in `.env.docker` is silently ignored without the flag, so ngrok stays disabled even when the user thought they enabled it. (Pass `-p <slug>-infra` too — see next row.)                          |
| Brought infra `up`/`down` without `-p <slug>-infra`             | Infra gets absorbed into the worktree's group (via the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` `--env-file` injects) and the data volume is renamed per-worktree. Always pass **both** `-p <slug>-infra` and `--env-file`. |
| Ran `docker compose restart` to pick up env-var changes         | `restart` does not re-read env files. Use `up -d` (with `--build -V` if dependencies changed).                                                                                                                          |
| Collapsed to dev + prod without asking                          | Environment count is the user's call (Q6). Default is dev + preview + prod (`preview → preview`, matching Vercel); only drop the preview lane when the user asks.                                                         |
| Added `process.env.FOO` read without touching `environment.ts`  | Every var goes through `EnvSchema` in `environment.ts` + `.env.docker.example`, and is announced to the user. Scattered silent `process.env` reads are exactly what Q7 exists to stop.                                   |
| Shipped `environment.ts` unchanged on a non-Vercel project      | The `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` detection only works on Vercel. Swap the signal for the target platform's equivalent, or detection silently resolves to `development` everywhere.                                            |
